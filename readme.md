# Webpack Examples

## Motivation
This is a series of webpack examples for only demonstration purposes

## How to use
Every example is a diferent branch, so you only have to switch to respective branch, and run:
```
$npm install
$npm start
```

After that, an http-server will start (mostly in port 8080), so check the code in http://127.0.0.1:8080 in your browser and open the console, check the messages
